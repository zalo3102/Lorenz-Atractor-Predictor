# Lorenz-Atractor-Predictor
In this project, the dynamical equations of the Lorenz attractor were solved for a set of different initial conditions, thereby generating the dataset used for this problem. The final objective was to study the predictive capacity of time series, such as these trajectories, using models based on fully connected neural networks, RNNs, and LSTMs. This process was implemented using PyTorch and Keras. The spatial components of the trajectories were normalized by applying z-score standardization to facilitate the training of the models as well as their learning.
