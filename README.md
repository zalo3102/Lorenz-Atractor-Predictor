# Lorenz-Atractor-Predictor
In this project, the dynamical equations of the Lorenz attractor were solved for a set of different initial conditions, thereby generating the dataset used for this problem. The ultimate goal was to predict the trajectories using simple neural networks, RNNs, and LSTMs. This process was implemented using PyTorch and Keras.
